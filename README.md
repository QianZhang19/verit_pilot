# Verit Pilot Study: Hybrid Wallet and Dashboard Interfaces

Welcome to the Verit Pilot Study repository. This project aims to evaluate the user experience, security, performance, and integration of the hybrid wallet and dashboard interfaces for Verit’s decentralized identity and credential verification platform.

## Objective
The pilot study is designed to ensure the wallet and admin dashboard meet user needs and align with Verit’s core values of security, usability, and seamless integration with decentralized identity (DID) systems.

## Key Areas of Focus
- **User Experience (UX):**
  - Ease of use and intuitiveness
  - Satisfaction with wallet and dashboard navigation
- **Security:**
  - Secure management and protection of credentials
  - User control over privacy settings and data disclosures
- **Performance:**
  - Responsiveness and speed
  - Handling of large-scale user data
- **Integration:**
  - Compatibility with Verit platform components (DID issuance, verification)
  - Smooth interaction between decentralized and centralized features
- **Feedback Collection:**
  - Gathering both qualitative and quantitative data on usability, functionality, and satisfaction

## Pilot Study Design
### 1. Participants
- **Target Audience:** 5-10 early adopters (internal stakeholders or select external testers) with varying technical expertise.
- **Selection Criteria:**
  - Experience with decentralized identity systems or digital wallets
  - A mix of users with different privacy/security concerns

### 2. Methodology
- **Pre-Test Survey:** Assess participants’ experience with digital wallets and decentralized systems.
- **Task-Based Testing:**
  - **Wallet Tasks:**
    - Add and verify credentials
    - Share credentials with external verifiers
    - Use selective disclosure for privacy
  - **Dashboard Tasks (Admin):**
    - Add/manage users and credentials
    - Configure permissions
    - Monitor and track credential status
- **Scenario-Based Testing:** Realistic scenarios for both users and admins
- **Security Evaluation:** Simulated attacks (e.g., unauthorized access, phishing) to test data privacy and security protocols

### 3. Data Collection
- **Quantitative:**
  - Task completion time
  - Number of errors
  - System performance (response times)
- **Qualitative:**
  - User feedback on usability and security
  - Suggestions for improvement

### 4. Metrics for Success
- **User Experience:** 85%+ successful task completion within 2 minutes per task
- **Security:** 100% participant confidence in security features
- **Performance:** No significant delays/errors with 100+ credentials
- **Feedback:** 80%+ positive usability/functionality responses

### 5. Timeline
- **Week 1:** Preparation (tasks, participant selection, infrastructure)
- **Weeks 2-3:** Study execution (testing, data collection)
- **Week 4:** Analysis (results, feedback consolidation)
- **Week 5:** Reporting & iteration (design revisions, next steps)

### 6. Results Analysis
- Analyze quantitative data for bottlenecks or user difficulties
- Review qualitative feedback for emotional responses and concerns
- Compare performance against success metrics

## Outcome & Next Steps
Following the pilot study:
- Refine wallet and dashboard interfaces for improved usability and security
- Implement additional security measures or design changes as needed
- Decide on broader release or further testing rounds
